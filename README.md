# Fable - Online Hotel Booking Application

Fable is a modern, elegant online hotel booking web application developed using Django. It allows users to browse, book, and manage hotel stays seamlessly.

The backend is powered by Django, and the project is structured into three main Django apps:
- **AuthApp**: Handles user authentication (login, registration, logout).
- **MainApp**: Manages homepage, general pages, and common functionalities.
- **HotelApp**: Manages hotel listings, hotel details, and booking logic.

The core Django project is contained inside the **FableProject** directory.
